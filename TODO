ðŸ‘‰ send Alex a few txt files with the reports from January 9th for the following domains:

- nashvillerealestate.com
- domorealestate.com
- jboswellteam.com

ðŸ‘‰ check on your end to ensure there's nothing in your system that blocks access to VPS else send Alex a few estimates on how much it will cost to have a VPS from Google, AWS, and DO.

ðŸ‘‰ reports should be sent individually to our clients, they should be broken down by domain name

ðŸ‘‰ how did you manage to generate the report for the last week when I only started sending emails to dmarc@sh-reports.com two days ago
