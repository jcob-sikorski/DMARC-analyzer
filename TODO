ðŸ‘‰ send Alex a few txt files with the reports from January 9th for the following domains:

- nashvillerealestate.com
- domorealestate.com
- jboswellteam.com

ðŸ‘‰ do not rely on the time the report came to the inbox but rather on xml <date_range> tag

ðŸ‘‰ generate these reports

ðŸ‘‰ check on your end to ensure there's nothing in your system that blocks access to VPS else send Alex a few estimates on how much it will cost to have a VPS from Google, AWS, and DO.

ðŸ‘‰ clarify which domain the report is for? Or is it a combined report? Since these 

ðŸ‘‰ reports should be sent individually to our clients, they should be broken down by domain name

ðŸ‘‰ how did you manage to generate the report for the last week when I only started sending emails to dmarc@sh-reports.com two days ago
